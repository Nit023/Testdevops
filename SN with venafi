Integrating ServiceNow with Venafi enables organizations to automate and streamline the management of machine identities—like TLS/SSL certificates—within their IT service workflows. Here's how it typically works and what you can achieve:
🔗 Integration Overview
	• Purpose: Automate certificate lifecycle management (request, issuance, renewal, revocation) using Venafi TLS Protect, while leveraging ServiceNow’s ITSM capabilities.
	• Method: Integration is usually done via REST APIs, MID Servers, or using prebuilt apps from the ServiceNow Store.
🛠️ Key Features of the Integration
	• Self-Service Certificate Requests: Users can request certificates directly from ServiceNow.
	• Automated Deployment: Certificates are issued and installed automatically via Venafi.
	• Renewal & Revocation: Scheduled renewals and revocations are handled without manual intervention.
	• CMDB Synchronization: Certificates and related assets are mapped to Configuration Items (CIs) in ServiceNow.
	• Incident Creation: Automatically generate incidents for expiring or misconfigured certificates.
📦 Available Solutions
	• The Machine Identity Protection app by Aeyrix Inc. on the ServiceNow Store is a comprehensive solution that supports:
		○ Integration with both Venafi TLS Protect Datacenter and Cloud
		○ Multi-environment support
		○ Change management workflows
		○ Bulk operations like renew/revoke
		○ Enhanced notification and approval processes
🧩 Implementation Notes
	• A MID Server is required to connect ServiceNow with Venafi’s REST API.
	• PowerShell scripts may be used for encryption and automation tasks.
	• Integration Hub is not required, but ServiceNow’s ITSM module is necessary.
If you're planning to implement this, I can help you sketch out a workflow or explore automation platforms like n8n that simplify custom integrations. Want to dive into setup steps or explore use cases?


Setting up the ServiceNow–Venafi integration involves configuring both platforms to securely communicate and automate certificate lifecycle management. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to guide you through the process:
🧰 Pre-Requisites
	• MID Server installed and configured in ServiceNow
	• Venafi Trust Protection Platform (TPP) or TLS Protect Cloud with REST API access
	• ServiceNow ITSM module activated
	• Admin credentials for both platforms
⚙️ Configuration Steps
1. Install the Machine Identity Protection App
	• Download the app from the ServiceNow Store
	• Import the update set XML via System Update Sets > Retrieved Update Sets
	• Preview and commit the update set
2. Configure MID Server
	• Ensure MID Server can reach Venafi’s REST API endpoint: https://<tpp_server_fqdn>/vedsdk
	• Validate connectivity from TPP to ServiceNow: https://<instance>.service-now.com
3. ServiceNow Setup
	• Create a dedicated user account for Venafi access
	• Assign roles: x_palad_machine.mips_user, Import_transformer
	• In the app’s Configuration Module, enter:
		○ MID Server name
		○ Venafi API endpoint
		○ Username and password
4. Venafi TPP Setup
	• Create a user account with access to:
		○ Credential Objects
		○ CA Template Objects
	• Apply workflows to certificate folders:
		○ Stage 0: Approval for Certificate Processing
		○ Stage 800: Approval for Installation
		○ Stage 1400: Approval for Revocation
	• Configure renewal scripts and logging:
		○ Place PowerShell scripts in designated folders
		○ Create C:\TEMP for logs
		○ Restart Venafi Log Service
5. Download CA Templates
	• Navigate to the CA Template module in ServiceNow
	• Click Execute Now to sync templates from Venafi
🧪 Post-Installation Checks
	• Test certificate request and approval workflows
	• Validate automatic deployment and renewal
	• Confirm CMDB synchronization and incident generation
If you're using Venafi TLS Protect Cloud, additional encryption steps may be required for sensitive data. You can also explore low-code platforms like n8n to build custom workflows between ServiceNow and Venafi.
